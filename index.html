       <h3> My interests </h3> <br>
       <Text> 1. Entrepreneurship : From my late teen, the bug of startups has bitten me. My interest in business grew exponentially.</Text>
       <br>
       <Text>2. Fitness : This is lil' funny, as it is more than an effect rather than a interest.</Text>
       <br>
       <Text>3. Code : This is my new favourite interest which I've induced with my lot of hardwork and trying again and again.</Text>
